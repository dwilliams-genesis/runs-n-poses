## ðŸŒ¹ Runs N' Poses ðŸŒ¹ - protein-ligand co-folding prediction dataset and benchmark

This repository accompanies the pre-print: ["Have protein-ligand co-folding prediction methods moved beyond memorisation?"]()

This benchmark tests the ability of protein-ligand co-folding methods to generalize to systems different from those in their training set.
This is a zero-shot benchmark, provided that your method uses a structural training cutoff of 30 September 2021.

### `ground_truth.tar.gz`

            <chain_id_2>.sdf
            ...
        receptor.cif # Receptor structure in CIF format

        system.cif # System (receptors + ligands) structure in CIF format
    ...
```

### `msa_files.tar.gz`

Contains the MSA files for each system in the same fashion as seen in `examples/inputs/msa_files`.

### `train_similarity_scores.parquet`

Contains all calculated similarity metrics for Runs N' Poses dataset systems against the entire PDB. This was used to get the closest training systems based on SuCOS-pocket similarity (`sucos_shape_pocket_qcov`).

## Reproducing Figures

See `figures.ipynb` for the code used to generate the figures in the paper. This requires `predictions.tar.gz` and `annotations.csv`.

## Running Predictions

See `input_preparation.ipynb` for instructions on how to prepare the input for the four benchmarked methods. This requires `inputs.json`. See the `examples/inputs` folder for an example of an input file for each method. See `examples/utils` for example commands to run predictions with each benchmarked method. To execute those command please follow instructions on their github pages.

## Extracting Accuracy Metrics

See the `examples/utils`, `examples/analysis` and `extract_scores.ipynb` for instructions on how to run accuracy scoring and extract relevant accuracy metrics for each method. This requires `ground_truth.tar.gz`, `inputs.json` and `annotations.csv`.

## Similarity scoring

See `similarity_scoring.py` for how we calculated the similarity metrics. This requires an entire copy of the PDB, the PLINDER dataset, and large amounts of memory. The same functionality will shortly be added to [PLINDER](https://github.com/plinder-org/plinder).
The processed output of this script can be found in `train_similarity_scores.parquet`.
